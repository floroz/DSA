# Data Structures, Algorithms and Frontend Practice Repository

This repository serves as a personal collection of implementations, solutions, and practice exercises related to Data Structures, Algorithms, and Frontend Development challenges.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

*   **`/data-structures`**: Contains implementations of various common data structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, Stacks, Queues) primarily in TypeScript. Each structure usually comes with corresponding tests.
*   **`/algorithms`**: Includes implementations of fundamental algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Graph algorithms) in TypeScript, along with tests.
*   **`/problems`**: Features solutions to various coding problems, often sourced from platforms like LeetCode, categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees). Solutions are primarily in JavaScript or TypeScript.
*   **`/frontend`**: Contains a React/Vite frontend application setup, potentially used for visualizing data structures/algorithms or hosting frontend challenges. Includes specific challenges like:
    *   `/frontend/src/challenges/contact-form`
    *   `/frontend/src/challenges/todo-list`
*   **`/great-frontend-75`**: Holds solutions to challenges from the "Great Frontend" collection, focusing on common frontend interview questions and utilities (e.g., `debounce`, `throttle`, `EventEmitter`, `Promise.all`).

## Getting Started

- `npm install` for the Data Structure and Algorithms
- `cd frontend && npm install` for the React Renderer, followed by `npm run dev` to run the app locally

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal learning repository, but suggestions or corrections are welcome via issues or pull requests.
